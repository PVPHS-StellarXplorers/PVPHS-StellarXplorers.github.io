                    We recuit new members at the beginning of each school year. 
                    Information is pushed out via the school's daily bulletin and students are welcome to contact us with any additional questions.
                    <br><br>
                    The roster is limited to 30 members (36 is potentially possible, but unlikely) and selection is application-based. The application mainly focuses on time-committment and interest in the program; prior knowledge isn't considered.
