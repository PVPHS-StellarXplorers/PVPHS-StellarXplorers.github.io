                        Palos Verdes Peninsula High School (PVPHS) provides the opportunity to compete in the Air & Space Forces Association’s (AFA) StellarXplorers Program.
                        <br><br>
                        Teams of 2-6 compete to solve realistic space scenarios – e.g. determining the optimal orbit to observe migrating whales, selecting the optimal satellite components to measure the moon’s water, determining the launch vehicle and system to launch a satellite to another planet, etc. – in a six-hour period. 
                        Teams are forced to trade choices in order to maximize their points in a multi-variable problem and compete against hundreds of other teams worldwide.
                    </p>

                    <p style="font-size:70%">
                        All teams compete in 6 rounds: 3 practice rounds and 3 qualifying rounds. 
                        The sum of their scores over the 3 qualifying rounds is used to determine their advancement to the semi-finals round, where their score is wiped. 
                        Their performance in the semi-final round determines their selection for the finals rounds, where the teams are flown out to compete with the rest of the top 10 teams.
                        <br>
                         - Round 1: Orbit selection round, using Ansys STK
